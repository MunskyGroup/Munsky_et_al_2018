# Munsky_et_al_2018
This folder will contain all files necessary to reproduce the figures in the manuscript, "Distribution Shapes Govern the "Distribution Shapes Govern the Discovery of Predictive Models for Gene Regulation" 
Brian E. Munsky, Guoliang Li, Zachary R. Fox, Douglas P. Shepherd, Gregor Neuert

Some of the figures require a data file ('RNAspots.mat') that is too large to host on GitHub.  This file can be downloaded from:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/g8i0tuwzy6eqjkw/RNAspots.mat?dl=0

For the codes to run, you will need to download and move this data file to the directory: 'Codes/Hog_Data/'

Questions should be addressed to Brian Munsky: munsky@colostate.edu
